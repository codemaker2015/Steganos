ABSTRACT

Steganography is the art of hiding the fact that communication is taking place, by hiding information in other information. Many different carrier file formats can be used, but digital images are the most popular because of their frequency on the internet. For hiding secret information in images, there exists a large variety of steganography techniques some are more complex than others and all of them have respective strong and weak points. Different applications may require absolute invisibility of the secret information, while others require a large secret message to be hidden. This project report intends to give an overview of image steganography, its uses and techniques. It also attempts to identify the requirements of a good steganography algorithm and briefly reflects on which steganographic techniques are more suitable for which applications.

 
INTRODUCTION

One of the reasons that intruders can be successful is the most of the information they acquire from a system is in a form that they can read and comprehend. Intruders may reveal the information to others, modify it to misrepresent an individual or organization, or use it to launch an attack. One solution to this problem is, through the use of steganography. Steganography is a technique of hiding information in digital media. In contrast to cryptography, it is not to keep others from knowing the hidden information but it is to keep others from thinking that the information even exists.
Steganography become more important as more people join the cyberspace revolution.  Steganography is the art of concealing information in ways that prevents the detection of hidden messages. Stegranography include an array of secret communication methods that hide the message from being seen or discovered.
Due to advances in ICT, most of information is kept electronically. Consequently, the security of information has become a fundamental issue. Besides cryptography, streganography can be employed to secure information. In cryptography, the message or encrypted message is embedded in a digital host before passing it through the network, thus the existence of the message is unknown. Besides hiding data for confidentiality, this approach of information hiding can be extended to copyright protection for digital media: audio, video and images.
The growing possibilities of modern communications need the special means of security especially on computer network. The network security is becoming more important as the number of data being exchanged on the internet increases.  Therefore, the confidentiality and data integrity  are requires to protect against unauthorized access and use. This has resulted in an explosive growth of the field of information hiding
Information hiding is an emerging research area, which encompasses applications such as copyright protection for digital media, watermarking, fingerprinting, and steganography.
	In watermarking applications, the message contains information such as owner identification and a digital time stamp, which usually applied for copyright protection.
	Fingerprint, the owner of the data set embeds a serial number that uniquely identifies the user of the data set. This adds to copyright information to makes it possible to trace any unauthorized used of the data set back to the user.
	Steganography hide the secrete message within the host data set and presence imperceptible and is to be reliably communicated to a receiver. The host data set is purposely corrupted, but in a covert way, designed to be invisible to an information analysis.

What is Steganography?
Steganography is the practice of hiding private or sensitive information within something that appears to be nothing out to the usual. Steganography is often confused with cryptology because the two are similar in the way that they both are used to protect important information. The difference between two is that steganography involves hiding information so it appears that no information is hidden at all. If a person or persons views the object that the information is hidden inside of he or she will have no idea that there is any hidden information, therefore the person will not attempt to decrypt the information.
What steganography essentially does is exploit human perception, human senses are not trained to look for files that have information inside of them, although this software is available that can do what is called Steganography. The most common use of steganography is to hide a file inside another file.
 
History of Steganography:
Through out history Steganography has been used to secretly communicate information between people.
Some examples of use of Steganography is past times are:
1.	During World War 2 invisible ink was used to write information on pieces of paper so that the paper appeared to the average person as just being blank pieces of paper. Liquids such as milk, vinegar and fruit juices were used, because when each one of these substances are heated they darken and become visible to the human eye.
2.	In Ancient Greece they used to select messengers and shave their head, they would then write a message on their head. Once the message had been written the hair was allowed to grow back. After the hair grew back the messenger was sent to deliver the message, the recipient would shave off the messengers hair to see the secrete message.
3.	Another method used in Greece was where someone would peel wax off a tablet that was


 
Why This Steganography?
This technique is chosen, because this system includes not only imperceptibility but also un-delectability by any steganolysis tool.

Project Scope: 
This project is developed for hiding information in any image file. The scope of the project is implementation of steganography tools for hiding information includes any type of information file and image files and the path where the user wants to save Image and extruded file.

Methodology:
User needs to run the application. The user has two tab options – encrypt and decrypt. If user select encrypt, application give the screen to select image file, information file and option to save the image file. If user select decrypt, application gives the screen to select only image file and ask path where user want to save the secrete file.
This project has two methods – Encrypt and Decrypt.
In encryption the secrete information is hiding in with any type of image file.
Decryption is getting the secrete information from image file.

 
Software Requirements:
•	.NET Framework 3.5

Hardware Requirements:
Processor: Preferably 1.0 GHz or Greater.
RAM      : 512 MB or Greater.

Limitations of the Software:
This project has an assumption that is both the sender and receiver must have shared some secret information before imprisonment. Pure steganography means that there is none prior information shared by two communication parties.

 
Detecting Steganography:
The art of detecting Steganography is referred to as Steganalysis.
To put is simply Steganalysis involves detecting the use of Steganography inside of a file. Steganalysis does not deal with trying to decrypt the hidden information inside of a file, just discovering it.
There are many methods that can be used to detect Steganography such as:
“Viewing the file and comparing it to another copy of the file found on the Internet (Picture file). There are usually multiple copies of images on the internet, so you may want to look for several of them and try and  compare the suspect file to them. For example if you download a JPED and your suspect file is also a JPED and the two files look almost  identical apart from the fact that one is larger than the other, it is most probable you suspect file has hidden information inside of it.

Future Enhancements:
To make it pure steganography application.






Problem Statement:
The former consists of linguistic or language forms of hidden writing. The later, such as invisible ink, try of hide messages physically. One disadvantage of linguistic steganography is that users must equip themselves to have a good knowledge of linguistry. In recent years, everything is trending toward digitization. And with the development of the internet technology, digital media can be transmitted conveniently over the network. Therefore, messages can be secretly carried by digital media by using the steganography techniques, and then be transmitted through the internet rapidly
Steganography is the art of hiding the fact that communication is taking place, by hiding information in other information. Many different carrier file formats can be used, but digital images are the most popular because of their frequency on the internet. For hiding secret information in images, there exists a large variety of steganography techniques some are more complex than others and all of them have respective strong and weak points.
So we prepare this application, to make the information hiding more simple and user friendly.
 
Objective

The goal of steganography is covert communication. So, a fundamental requirement of this steganography system is that the hider message carried by stego-media should not be sensible to human beings.

The other goad of steganography is to avoid drawing suspicion to the existence of a hidden message. This approach of information hiding technique has recently became important in a number of application area
This project has following objectives:
•	To product security tool based on steganography techniques.
•	To explore techniques of hiding data using encryption module of this project
•	To extract techniques of getting secret data using decryption module.
Steganography sometimes is used when encryption is not permitted. Or, more commonly, steganography is used to supplement encryption. An encrypted file may still hide information using steganography, so even if the encrypted file is deciphered, the hidden message is not seen


 
Overview

The word steganography comes from the Greek “Seganos”, which mean covered or secret and – “graphy” mean writing or drawing. Therefore, steganography mean, literally, covered writing. It is the art and science of hiding information such its presence cannot be detected and a communication is happening. A secrete information is encoding in a manner such that the very existence of the information is concealed. Paired with existing communication methods, steganography can be used to carry out hidden exchanges.
The main goal of this projects it to communicate securely in a completely undetectable manner and to avoid drawing suspicion to the transmission of a hider data. There has been a rapid growth of interest in steganography for two reasons:
The publishing and broadcasting industries have become interested in techniques for hiding encrypted copyright marks and serial numbers in digital films, audio recordings, books and multimedia products
Moves by various governments to restrict the availability of encryption services have motivated people to study methods by which private messages can be embedded in seemingly innocuous cover messages.
The basic model of steganography consists of Carrier, Message and password. Carrier is also known as cover-object, which the message is embedded and serves to hide the presence of the message.
 

Basically, the model for steganography is shown on following figure:

 

Message is the data that the sender wishes to remain it confidential. It can be plain text, ciphertext, other image, or anything that can be embedded in a bit stream such as a copyright mark, a covert communication, or a serial number. Password is known as stego-key, which ensures that only recipient who know the corresponding decoding key will be able to extract the message from a cover-object. The cover-object with the secretly embedded message is then called the Stego-object.
Recovering message from a stego-object  requires the cover-object itselt and a corresponding decoding key if a stego-key was used during the encoding process. The original image may or may not be required in most applications to extract the message.
There are several suitable carriers below to be the cover-object:
•	Network protocols such as TCP, IP and UDP
•	Audio that using digital audio formats such as wav, midi, avi, mpeg, mpi and voc
•	File and Disk that can hides and append files by using the slack space
•	Text such as null characters, just alike morse code including html and java
•	Images file such as bmp, gif and jpg, where they can be both color and gray-scale.
In general, the information hiding process extracts redundant bits from cover-object. The process consists of two steps:
•	Identification of redundant bits in a cover-object. Redundant bits are those bits that can be modified without corrupting the quality or destroying the integrity of the cover-object.
•	Embedding process then selects the subset of the redundant bits to be replaced with data from a secret message. The stego-object is created by replacing the selected redundant bits with message bits
